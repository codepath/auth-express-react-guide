# A Guide to User Authentication and Session Management (React + Express)

## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to implement various common use cases related to user authentication and session management using React, Express, and Postgresql (via Sequelize). 

The primary use cases that will be covered include:

1. Signing in/Signing up and redirecting to a logged in screen
2. Refreshing the page with user-specific elements post login
3. Remaining signed in after page reload
4. Logging out and redirecting to the home page
5. Fetching data customized for the signed in user
6. Redirecting to the home page when accessing a signed-in user only route
